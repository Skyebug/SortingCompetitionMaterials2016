# SortingCompetitionMaterials2016

Materials for UMM CSci 3501 "Algorithms and computability" 2016 sorting competition.

## Goal of the competition

The Sorting Competition is a multi-lab exercise on developing the fastest sorting algorithm for a given type of data. By "fast" we mean the actual running time and not the Big-Theta approximation. The solutions are developed in Java and will be ran on a single processor.

## The data

The data file starts with coordinates of two points on a square grid of integers that we will refer to as *reference points*. The size of the grid is referred to as `gridSize` and will be between `50000` and `200000`. Each point is given on its own line; its X coordinate followed by the Y coordinate, separated by spaces. 

The data to be sorted consists of triples of integers. The first two elements are X and Y coordinates of each point to be sorted, followed by a timestamp, which also can be viewed just as the number of the point in the sequence, starting with 0 and up `N - 1` (where `N` is the total number of points to be sorted). 

## How do you need to sort the data 

The points are sorted based on their distance to **the closer** of the two reference points. If the distance is smaller than the threshold `0.0000000001`, it is considered zero. If the two points being compared have the difference of their distances to the closest reference point within the treshold, they are considered to be at the equal distance. In this case the point with the smaller timestamp is considered smaller. 

## How is the data generated

The points are generated as a sequence of *walks*. The first walk starts at the middle of the grid, subsequent walks start at the end point of a previous walk. The walks are generated until the desired number of points (denoted `N`) is generated. Each walk is generated as follows:
* The length of the walk (the number of points in it) is randomly generated between `walkMin` and `walkMax`. 
* A random direction is generated. Its angle is a double between 0 and 360, where 0 indicates the positive direction of X coordinate.
* A random *speed* is generated as an integer between 0 and `maxSpeed`.
All distributions are uniform, including the lower bound and excluding the upper one. 

Walk points are generated by "moving" in the chosen direction by the chosen step. If a generated coordinate is negative or over the `gridSide`, the motion is "wrapped around": `gridSide` is added to negative coordinates and subtracted from a coordinate greater than `gridSide`. The walk continues from that point. 

The points of the walk are recorded as a triple of integers: the `X` coordinate, the `Y` coordinate, and the timestamp which is simply teh number of the point in the sequence (the start point of the first sequence has timestamp `0`, and is incremented by `1` for every point). The triples are written out one per line, as integers separated by spaces, in the order in which sequences were generated.  

The last walk may be shorter than its randomly generated length so that the total number of points is exactly `N`.  

The changeable parameters to the data generation are as follows: 
* `gridSize` can be between `50000` and `200000` (inclusive)
* Number of points can be between `100000` and `1000000`
* Minimum walk length can be between `1` and `100`
* Maximum walk length can be between `100` and `1000`
* Maximum speed can be between `50` and `300`. The minimum speed is always zero. 
**TBD**: add the ability to set parameters for data generator from the command line. 

Once the data is generated, it is written out to the output file (the name supplied on the command line for the data generator). Here is a beginning of data file:
```
23597 83108
67067 36505
50000 50000 0
49950 50026 1
49900 50052 2
49850 50078 3
49800 50104 4
49750 50130 5
49700 50156 6
49650 50182 7
49600 50208 8
```
Here the two reference points are `(23597, 83108)` and `(67067, 36505)`, and the sequence of points starts at `(50000, 50000)` witha  timestamp `0`, and continues from there.
